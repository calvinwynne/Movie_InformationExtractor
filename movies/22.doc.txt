Gangs of New York is a 2002 American epic historical drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan, based on Herbert Asbury's 1927 book The Gangs of New York. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz, with Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, and Brendan Gleeson in supporting roles. In 1863, a long-running Catholic-Protestant feud erupts into violence, just as an Irish immigrant group is protesting the low wages caused by an influx of freed slaves as well as the threat of conscription. Scorsese spent 20 years developing the project until Harvey Weinstein and his production company Miramax Films acquired it in 1999. Made in Cinecitt√†, Rome and Long Island City, New York City, Gangs of New York was completed by 2001, but its release was delayed due to the September 11 attacks. The film was theatrically released in the United States on December 20, 2002 and grossed over $193 million worldwide. It was met with critical acclaim and received ten nominations at the 75th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese, and Best Actor for Day-Lewis.
