2 Fast 2 Furious is a 2003 action film directed by John Singleton and written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, with a story also credited to Gary Scott Thompson. A standalone sequel to The Fast and the Furious (2001), it is the second installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, and James Remar. 2 Fast 2 Furious follows Brian O'Conner and Roman Pearce who go undercover for the U.S. Customs Service to apprehend a drug lord in exchange for the erasure of their criminal records. Plans for a sequel to The Fast and the Furious were developed immediately following that film's box office success. Early treatments for a sequel initially featured the returns of both Vin Diesel and Walker; the former declined, instead choosing to star in The Chronicles of Riddick (2004). John Singleton, who critically praised the first film, was announced to direct the second in place of Rob Cohen, who left the franchise after directing the previous installment. Principal photography began in September 2002 and lasted until that December, with filming locations including Miami and South Florida. 2 Fast 2 Furious was released worldwide by Universal Pictures on June 6, 2003. The film grossed over $235 million worldwide, becoming the 17th highest-grossing film of 2003, and the then-highest grossing film in the franchise. The third installment, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, was released in 2006.
